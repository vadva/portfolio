                    I'm looking for inspiration everywhere. 
                    Today, designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website’s overall functionality. 
                    Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.When designing a website it’s important to consider both the site’s appearance and functionality. 
                    Integrating these elements will maximize the site’s overall usability and performance. 
                    Your site’s usability includes elements such as an easy-to-navigate interface, appropriate use of graphics and images, well-written and well-placed text, and a color scheme

                <p>
                    A great website layout is a conundrum: it’s often best when it isn’t noticed at all. 
                    Which is to say, if the designer has done her job right, the user will be able to find the product specs, the shopping cart, the promotional offers, and—most importantly—the purchase button without ever having to think about it. 
                    After all, more time spent figuring out how to use a website means less attention paid to its actual content..

                    For almost a decade now, JavaScript is spoken of as one of the most demanded programming languages on the market. 
                    That is mostly because of its wide and growing range of usability and possibilities for developers who embrace its dynamic nature and learn it.

                <p>
                    I like Java for several reasons:

                    Platform Independence: Java is a "write once, run anywhere" language. This means that code written in Java can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This platform independence is a significant advantage for cross-platform development.
                    
                    Strong Typing: Java is a statically typed language, which means that type checking is done at compile-time. This helps catch errors early in the development process and makes code more robust.
                    
                    Rich Standard Library: Java has a vast and comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of functions and classes, making it easier and faster to develop applications. This extensive library covers everything from data structures to networking.
                    
                    Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which promotes the use of reusable and modular code through the use of classes and objects. This makes code organization and maintenance more manageable.
                    
                    Memory Management: Java has automatic memory management through garbage collection. Developers don't need to manage memory explicitly, reducing the chances of memory leaks and related issues.
